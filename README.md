**e-liner**

- Uses Orton Gillingham instruction
- Use multisensory techniques
- Use spaced repetition to remind children to reinforce their knowledge
- Emphasizing on syllable types for Orton-Gillingham

Activities:

- Breaking down words into simpler syllables and relating them to usage.
    - Could be done by asking the child to circle the parts of the word that are different from the root word and instead add more to the word.
